The GUI Tool for Image Denoising Research (dubbed GAMBIT) hopes to reduce evaluation, testing, and verification time of new research into the domain of Image Denoising. This is a collection of tools that should drastically speed up the rate of innovation by reducing the time spent on testing so that researchers spend time on ideation instead.

Initial lifecycle of the tool will be like so: pre-apha -> alpha -> beta -> v1.x -> ...

The tool is current in pre-alpha as a collection of loose scripts. In the coming weeks, a CLI tool will be developed with a variety of features as listed. We will start with a basic implementation with more complex offerings part of the beta.
